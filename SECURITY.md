## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within `nxt-gen`, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** This could expose the vulnerability before we have a chance to fix it.
2. Send an email to the maintainer via <https://praboth.me>.
3. Include as much detail as possible:
    * Type of issue (e.g., injection, XSS, etc.)
    * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
    * Any relevant code snippets or logs.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for the fix.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., `1.0.x`). We recommend always staying on the latest version to ensure you have the latest security patches.
